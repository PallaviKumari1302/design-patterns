## Design Patterns:
Reusable solution for common problems in software design.

Refer to structured approaches involving objects and classes that aim to solve recurring design issues within specific contexts.

These patterns offer reusable, general solutions to common problems encountered in software development, representing established best practices

### There are three types of Design Patterns:

### 1. Creational Design Pattern
Focus on the process of creating objects. 

Aim to enhance flexibility and efficiency in object creation, allowing systems to remain independent of how their objects are constructed, composed, and represented.

ex. Factory, Singleton, Prototype, Builder

### 2. Structural Design Pattern
Focus on how classes and objects are arranged to create larger, more complex structures in software development. 

They help organize relationships between objects, making systems more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

ex. Adapter, Proxy, Bridge

### 3. Behavioural Design Pattern
Focus on how objects and classes interact and communicate in software development. 

They emphasize the collaboration between objects to effectively accomplish tasks and responsibilities, making the system more manageable and adaptable

ex. Interpreter, template, iterator

#### Note: Scope of these design pattern can be Class/Object
